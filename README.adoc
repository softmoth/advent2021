# Advent of Code 2021 exercises

I was inspired to do it by

## Day 1

I learned `std::io::stdin().lines()`, which handles locking automatically in recent Rust.

Chris Biscardi introduced me to *dhat*, a very simple heap profiler. So far, that along with `/usr/bin/time` is enough to do some basic testing.

## Day 2

I rewrote this several times. First with a naÃ¯ve `split_whitespace()` parser, and then using `nom` (introduced by Chris Biscardi). Basically I copied his approach verbatim.

I did learn how to return an enum value from a function, and then call it later. The trick is to cast the enum value explicitly to `fn(i32) -> Command`. Otherwise it looks like `fn(i32) -> Command {Command::Down}` (i.e., it's too specific) and the compiler thinks each value is of a different type. That was satisfying to get working.

## Day 3

Working with BTreeSet was interesting. For part 1 (solution not kept) I just kept a count of how many entries had each bit set. But part 2 required storing all of the entries and whittling them down. At first I tried `.filter_drain()`, but then I found that an initial `.partition()` of the set allows the two questions to be answered without needing to duplicate any of the entries.
